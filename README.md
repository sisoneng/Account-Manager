My first WPF Desktop Application using MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architectural Pattern developed on Visual Studio 2019 .NET Framework 4.7. Published Version 1.0.0
 
1 week creation from scratch to published product. 
Design is not so good but not annoying. 
Practiced the MVVM Architectural Pattern
